# Guess Game Project

## Overview
This Guess Game project was developed during my Codecademy boot camp. The web application is an interactive guessing game where a user player competes against a computer player. The goal is to guess a target number randomly generated during each round. The player (user or computer) with a guess closer to the target number wins the round. The game includes a scoreboard that displays the user and computer scores, along with the current round number.

Project Components

#### 1. index.html

This file serves as the main entry point for the guessing game. It contains the structure and layout of the web application. The user interface elements and game display are defined in this HTML file.

#### 2. game.js

The game.js file houses all the game logic and event listeners. It is responsible for handling user input, managing the game state, determining the winner of each round, and updating the scoreboard and round counter accordingly.

#### 3. script.js

The script.js file plays a supporting role in the project. It contains helper functions and variables that assist in the execution of the game logic. This separation helps maintain a clean and modular code structure.

## How to Play
